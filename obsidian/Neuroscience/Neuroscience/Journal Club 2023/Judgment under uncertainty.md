The papers describes three heuristics [mental operations](mental%20operation.md) that are employed in judgment under uncertainty.
 1. [Representativeness](representativeness) or [Similarity](Similarity.md)
 2. Availability of instances
 3. Relative or [dissimilarity](dissimilarity)
## Main ideas
Many decisions are based on [[beliefs]] related to [[likelihood]] of uncertain events. Those are phrases as *'I think that ...'* , *'Chances are ...'*  etc.  
1. **But how people assess *these uncertainties*?
2. The pros/cons processes of doing so

## Contents

The author suggests that *subjective assessment* of **probability** and *subjective assessment* of **physical quantities** are alike. Both based on "data of **limited validity**". 
> The example is when the object is blurred. It will give off the senses of distance. The sharper object is more likely to be percept as being near.  

The author then discusses about three heuristic methods used to assess probabilities and values. The biases from these methods are observed with theoretical implications are discussed.

### 1. Representativeness
Representativeness heuristic methods are generally involved with how the estimating object represent the prior knowledge/stereotype. It is accompanied by systematic biases/error that sabotage those methods both in naive subjects and sophisticated subjects. The followings are biases/error from the representative heuristic.
#### 1.1 Insensitive to Prior
The insensitivity is observed via a simple question to judge the probability that the description fall upon any category. The first instinct comes that **we choose the most likely choices that fit *our* past experience knowledge**. That is, we use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) rather than Maximum Posterior (MAP). In most case, the probability should be estimated using **MAP** since the information from prior can refine our past knowledge.

#### 1.2 Insensitivity to Sample Size
Most people are naive to recognize the effect of sample size on estimation of statistics. The statistics value for larger sample size tend to distribute tightly around the best estimator by the [[law of large number]]. However, the effect from small sample size can largely affect the empirical findings which is oblivion to most people.

#### 1.3 Misconceptions of Chance
People tend to misinterpret the chance as **correction** process where the subsequent outcomes will balance out the fore-coming values. This create the famous [[Gamble's Fallacy]].


#### 1.4 Insensitivity to Predictability
People tends to predict the properties of the package as chunk. The more favorable description seems, the more positive estimation about that *package* will be made. However, the favorable description sometimes is not relevant to the other quality of the packages.

> if the descriptions of companies provide no information relevant to profit, then the same value (e.g., average profit) should be predicted for all companies.

People tend to disregard the overly confident in predictability of the prior information to **distant(in time/space or even topic)** estimation of quantity.

#### 1.5 The Illusion of Validity
The unwarranted confidence which is produced by a good fit between the predicted out- come and the input information may be called the illusion of validity.

#### 1.6 Misconceptions of Regression
People tends to not recognized the regression toward means. When the extreme values arose recently, the next one is more likely to be less extreme. **This should be obvious** from the definition of *percentile*. Unrecognized this concept led to misunderstanding the effects of rewards and punishments.

> People tend to give out a complement after one generally perform better (more extreme) than usual. After that the outperformer will be less likely to perform on par or better. **Then the compliment makes people worse**
> The contrary scenarios can be observed from poor performers as well. This lead to the false perception that **punishment** can improve the pupils.

### 2. Availability
I see this type of heuristic, *as limited access to information*. The ease of access and past experiences shape this type of heuristics.

#### 2.1 Biases due to the Retrievability of Instances
The subject erroneously judge the class that appear to be seen as more numerous. We may have a false perception from the biases in false-reality.

#### 2.2 Biases due to the Effectiveness of a [Search Set](search%20set)
In the demonstration, the semantic search performed to find the elements of set of english words starting with *'r'* is far easier compare to word with letter *'r'* at the third position. The biases are that people tends to believe that the easier search set is more numerous ( in this case, *the set of words starting with 'r'* ).

#### 2.3 Biases of Imaginability
In the abstract realm, the mental imagination is more likely to occurs (reflexively) of chunking in small numbers.
In the event of mental grouping, the small number chunking can be made easier (**retrievability**) and is then percept as **more numerous**.

#### 2.4. Illusory Correlation
Co-occurrences can be just coincidences

### 3. Adjustment and Anchoring
People tends to be made prediction near some fixated points whether it is ill predictive.

#### 3.1 Insufficient Adjustment
The adjustment can be observed in fast math problem. The unfinished calculation serves as the fixation point prior to adjustment.
$8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$
$1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 \times 6 \times 7 \times 8$
The first sequence tend to give out higher estimation if the given calculation time is too low.
#### 3.2 Biases in the Evaluation of Conjunctive and Disjunctive Events
People tends to overestimate the probability of successive occurrences (conjunctive) of highly probable events. But, they tend to underestimate the probability of rising less probable events.
This make us overestimate our chances of success in project planning phase because we underestimate the rising problem that looks unlikely to happen in all minor milestones but in reality, one or more problems are more likely to occurs.

#### 3.3 Anchoring in the Assessment of Subjective Probability Distributions
Prior experiences and percept world can result in strong anchoring in result. The fabricate information from other parties can sway our judgement as well as our beliefs.
